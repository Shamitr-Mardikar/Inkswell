# A Final Goodbye

The lingering scent of her perfume, a final whisper as she drained the last drop of her cocktail, marked the beginning of a long absence. It felt like carefully folding a precious memory and tucking it away, knowing it would be a while before I'd stumble upon it again. A bittersweet ache settled in my chest. 

On that last drive, returning her home, I smiled, my fingers intertwined with hers, even as tears traced paths down her cheeks. "You'd wait for me, wouldn't you?" she whispered, her voice fragile. 

Life, in its rare and tender moments, offers a chance to show someone the depth of their importance. Despite the urge to break down, despite the uncertainty of tomorrow – whether I'd even live to witness another sunrise – my heart ached to tell her I'd cross the seven seas simply to hear her voice again, to feel her arms around me, to inhale her intoxicating scent one last time. 

"Of course, honey," I managed, mustering every ounce of courage, "I’ll be seeing you soon."

The journey back to her place stretched into an eternity, each mile pulling me further from an urge that begged for just one more moment. One perfect, stolen moment, only to let her go again. She vanished from my sight, yet ever since, with every blink, her face appears—grinning, feet playfully kicking the air. 

God, I’d give up everything just to see that smile again.
